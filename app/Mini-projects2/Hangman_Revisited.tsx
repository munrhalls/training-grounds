/* for starters, attitude check
- there are NO TRIVIAL PROBLEMS
- DO NOT LEAVE DOOR OPEN FOR SUBTLE JUDGEMENTS THAT MAKE THE EGO FEAR -> TRIGGER DEFENSIVE MECHANISMS -> TRIGGER LACK OF HUMILITY AND SOME "you should be able to solve it super easy, it's simple"
- anything of this kind of insecure toxicity of other people who are afraid of being judged and so they say things like kids say when they laugh at each other - or project that kinda subtle attitude
- it also points towards parotting idiotic and ineffective approaches that have nothing to do with the stance of problem solving - which is openness and creativity and total childlike freedom to try a ton of different things with no expectation of any kind
- delete all that from your awareness, it's hyper-destructive crap that destroys sensitivity and carefulness and nimble relaxed rested harmonious and free ease in thinking that's #1 for dexterity of thoughtful exploration required to solve a problem with total explorative openness and flexibility
- ban that crap from your mind and ban people who have anything to do with such attitudes from your life 100% decisively and with infinite non-negiotable vehemance keep anything like that out of your system

Understanding the PROBLEM

### first thoughts
- this is circuit of some sort
- it's circuit: input submit ----> adds letter @_ _ _ _ _ _ _ or to failed attempt
- that split is likely to be very difficult, some kinda bundle of issues
- those can easily tangle up together and create a ton of stuckness
- it's insanely trickiness-prone and very easy to become very tangled up and infinitely complex and impossible to solve - high knot-making potential - if you are actually solving it 100% on your own (writing out some answer you saw somewhere - that's not solving, that's just being someone mindlessly self-deceptive and reciting something pre-made by someone else - that's not problem solving)
- I imagine 3-4 isolated, separate boxes of solving that need to then be connected in a specific way

### questions - exhaust - finding every Q that SHOULD be asked
- what is the input, actually?
- as a whole - it's user's ui-enabled interaction actions from start to end condition, and including restart possibility
- input = stream of letter input instances, one capital letter at a time
- output = stream of letter output instances
- so input can only be a letter? yes, block any other input; also capitalize every input

/// FOR DEBRIEF NOTICE - THIS IS EXAMPLE OF HOW EXHAUSTING QUESITONS THAT SHOULD BE ASKED LITERALLY SAVES TIME - THE SAME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A QUESTION WOULD HIT LATER ON BUT REINFORCED BY OTHER UNCERTAINTIES AND QUESTIONS *AT_THE_SAME_TIME* - YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THOSE QUESTIONS *ANYWAY* - THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER THEY ATTACK YOU AS A UNIFIED FRONT OF UNCERTAINTIES AND GET YOU OVERWHELMED AND STUCK, OR WHETHER YOU SPLIT THEM UP ON THE VERTICAL TIMELINE, ISOLATE AND PRE-SOLVE ONE BY ONE
/// BIG NOTICE ///
- what if user inputs same letter twice? if successful - only notify the user for a moment and reset input; if unsuccessful, substract x2 points and notify user for a moment - makes game more fun


#input letter instance
- e.g. 'A' or 'B' or 'C' or 'Z'
#letter output instance
- successful: _ A _ _ _ _ A (for gameword BANANA)
- failed: UI "Failed attempts": C X (input stream was 'C' 'X' 'A' )


### What am I looking for
- it's all about circuit from input to output that splits into one of two possible outcomes properly
- individual instance circuit to failed or successful output instance
- that circuit is decisive advantage point - once I have the circuit, all else is easier, mostly decorative
- solving the individual input to output instance circuit itself is difficult

### What do I know
-

/// LEAVING THAT IN FOR DEBRIEF PURPOSES ///
### more questions - zoning in on criticals
- what is that circuit, really?
- let's think it outside of react first // WAIT, THIS IS SOLVING ALREADY - WRONG!!! FIRST UNDERSTAND, THEN PLAN, ONLY THEN SOLVE... AND EVEN MORE SO, ONLY AFTER ALL THAT, THEN CODE...
