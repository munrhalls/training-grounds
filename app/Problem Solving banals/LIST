#### Understanding before action

### The problem is ambiguous? Stop trying to understsanding, stop planning, stop solving. stop. Ask a question.

### Never take shortcuts in understanding the problem. Aggressively find every question that should be asked.

### Familiarity is the enemy of understanding

### When your brain tries to take a shortcut and you're not looking...THAT'S WHEN YOU LOST

Because the problem looked simple and familiar ("classic input out f"), your brain skipped the rest of Step 1 (Understand) and jumped to a known pattern in Step 2 (Plan). Your "plan" (split, iterate, add to res) assumes the answers to Step 1 questions you hadn't even asked yet:

    What about "John" (one name)?

    What about "" (empty string)?

    What about "john smith" (lowercase)?

    What about "John Smith" (double spaces)? Your plan would fail on 3 out of 4 of those. You hadn't finished understanding the problem, but you were already planning a solution.

### Understand the general case, not just the specific example.

### When you got stuck and STAYED STUCK it's because your process lacked a few stages that would provide critical cover for the further steps. Your steps without that cover = fragile and unprepared for what they'd otherwise handle with ease.
