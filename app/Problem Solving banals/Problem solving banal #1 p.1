Please tackle a very delicate, nuanced task that's easy to get wrong:

crafting initial 2-3 deliberate practice exercises that take one most important primitive banal (in order) from the above video and challenge the student to see if they will fail that banal or not

e.g. an exercise that's as small and simple to execute (e.g. here, in chat window, least friction to just get on with it) as possible but successfully tests if the student respects that banal in their ACTION and DOING of problem solving - e.g. if they jump to solving a problem too soon, or too late, if they prepare relevantly or irrelevantly etc.

Here is the first exercise.

Exercise 1: The Ambiguous Request
The "Banal" Being Tested: "Understanding Before Action" (i.e., not "jump[ing] to solving... too soon").

Your Task: You need to write the pseudocode for a function that totals a list of items.

The function is calculate_total(items).

items is a list of item objects.

The function must return the final price.

A 5% tax must be applied to "taxable" items.

Here is an example items list: [ { name: "apple", price: 1 }, { name: "book", price: 10 } ]

What is your pseudocode?

// compare to past experience

- i did solve similar problems before, it's just a function, it gets input and must return something...focus on the return...carefully check and ask Q's about input...confirm each tentative point deliberately and explicitly...

// compare to similar problems

- it's like any function that just gets input, needs to iterate and track status of something, update stored var, return stored var

//

(IMPORTANT! ALERT! IMPORTANT! ALERT! IMPORTANT! ALERT! i first did this instinctively - just started my old normal solving process...only now adding above what i forgot to check doing first after learning video's points)

// confirm input

- is items always in the same format?

- is price always an integer?

// tax - taxable items

- does that means some are taxable or all are?

- what in the input indicates which are taxable/not taxable?

// find out determining taxable/non-taxable status

// iterate items

- store total

- determine if taxable

- calculate tax if needed

- add tax + price if needed

- add final item price to stored total

// return total taxed sum

This exercise successfully revealed the exact habit the video warns against.

Your response shows that your instinct was to jump to "Devise a Plan" (comparing to past experiences and similar problems) before you finished "Understanding the Problem."

You even caught this yourself, noting: (IMPORTANT! ALERT! i first did this instinctively).

The test was the ambiguity. The problem cannot be solved as given. There is no information on what makes an item "taxable."

The correct "first step" would not have been pseudocode. It would have been only the questions you asked after you had already started planning:

"what in the input indicates which are taxable/not taxable?"

"is price always an integer?"

"does that means some are taxable or all are?"

By "instinctively" starting to plan a solution, you "jump[ed] in too fast" without "look[ing] carefully at what's in front of you".
