/*
 * The Toggle-and-Display Unit
 *
 * Goal: Force a component to own and encapsulate its own display state and complex content.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Create a single component called TooltipFeature
 * - Contains one useState variable: [isTooltipVisible, setIsTooltipVisible]
 * - Renders a main Trigger Button
 * - Conditionally renders TooltipContent (with distinct style and close button) based on isTooltipVisible
 * - Ensure the entire Tooltip logic (trigger, state, content) is defined, managed, and exported from this single file
